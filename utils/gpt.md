# ADI Toolkit Chat Session

### User:

transmuxing vs remuxing vs transcoding

---

### Assistant:

**Transmuxing, Remuxing, and Transcoding** are terms related to digital video processing and streaming:

- **Transmuxing (Transport Stream Multiplexing):**  
  Changing the container format of a media stream without altering the encoded audio or video data. For example, converting an MPEG-TS stream to an MP4 container without re-encoding the streams. It’s basically “repackaging” the data.

- **Remuxing:**  
  Very similar to transmuxing, remuxing also involves changing the container format but keeping the original audio and video streams intact. Sometimes used interchangeably with transmuxing, though remuxing often refers specifically to combining streams (like audio and video) into a new container.

- **Transcoding:**  
  Re-encoding the audio or video streams, converting them from one codec or bitrate to another. This process changes the actual media data and is much more computationally intensive than transmuxing/remuxing.
